ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Bruno Unyime - Frontend Alchemist! 

Passionate about crafting delightful user experiences with JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS, and styling magic using Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS. While I'm known for my frontend finesse, I've got a versatile dance card with a stint in JavaScript, TypeScript, and a brief fling with the backend in Node.js.

âœ¨ Frontend Flourish
In the realm of front-end, I'm all about creating stunning, responsive, and pixel-perfect interfaces. I breathe life into designs with ReactJS and NextJS, adding that extra touch of magic.

ðŸš€ UI Architect
Championing Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS, I sculpt beautiful and intuitive UIs that leave users in awe. Design systems and component libraries are my playground.

ðŸŒˆ Creative Coder
Every line of code is an opportunity for creativity. I believe in writing functional but also elegant and maintainable code that stands the test of time.

ðŸ’¡ Learning Journey
As the frontend landscape evolves, so do I. I'm on a perpetual learning journey, exploring the latest trends and techniques to keep my skills sharp.
